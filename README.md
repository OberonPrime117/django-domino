# django-domino
Domino - Wendys hybrid website which uses django for backend and vue js for frontend

### Django 
  
   Firstly We need to activate the virtual environment 
  `source bin/activate`
  
  Then cd into the project directory containing the django files and the `manage.py` file. 
  And run the django server from there
  
  
  - `cd djangonautic`
  - `python manage.py runserver`

### VUE JS

   We will directly cd into the vue directory of the project and run the vue project from there
   
   
   `cd djangonautic-vue
    npm run serve`
